This is a long time needed script for my work as a DJ.

Downloading a lot of mp3, I got overwhelmed byt the amount of time I had to spent organizing them.

Opening a folder, drag and drop etc etc were taking to much precious time.

Then I met Python so I decided to fix this problem.

Now this script will move each mp3 to the folder that match its 'genre' ID3 Tag after confirming that 
you want to move it or send it to the trasj, or dont touch

I'm going to continue adding more functionlity to it
